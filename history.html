        <h3 class="text4">
            We were created to help families that could not provide the life saving support of a support animal
            <br> From vets that served our country to children with heart problems, these animals could be the difference between life and death.
            <br> Not everyone can afford these animals, we do everything we can to ensure that all of these people have a chance to get the animal they need.
            <br> Support animals are heros and will save lives if they are just given the chance to do so.
            <br> Help us save these people
